# Health Hopper
Medical Tourism made simple - currently focused on Turkey and more specifically the city of Antalya. 
Uses a python backend to ship the ML models and queries necessary to make application run. 

## Technical Description
A `next.js` application with a python backend server in `flask`
- Currently review scores generated by the backend are encoded into `data-with-predicted-value.csv` - which is interpretted by the front end

# To set Up
## Front End
- use your preferred node package installer (`pnpm` or `yarn` preferred) to install from `package.json`
- `(preferred installer) run dev` to run the application

## Back End
- you must set up a python virtual environment to get the same package abilities as `npm`
- the environment instructions are laid out in `./server/data-scraping/setup-virtual-env.md`
    - alternatively, just run the shell command in `/server/data-scraping` called `create-env.sh`
    - this can be done by just executing the shell command
    - doing this will install all dependencies and packages
- once this is created, you can simply run the server using `flask app.py` or `python app.py` in debug mode

## API Keys
- you must source the API keys yourself to make other functions of the website work
- API keys needed: 
    - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - for additional places API scraping
    - `OPENAI_KEY` - for additional text embedding
    - `SERP_API_KEY` - for getting google image results, etc.
