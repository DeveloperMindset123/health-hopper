Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.

Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process.

I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received.

I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!

I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I have visited the Global Dental Centre in Antalya on two occasions to have dental implants.

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I have visited the Global Dental Centre in Antalya on two occasions to have dental implants.

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED

Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I have visited the Global Dental Centre in Antalya on two occasions to have dental implants.

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve
Lovely ladies and made me feel very comfortable

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.

As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve
Lovely ladies and made me feel very comfortable

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth.

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Now, let's talk about the end result - WOW! My veneers have completely transformed my smile, and I couldn't be happier!

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!

Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!

Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

They were very reassuring and they’ve supported me throughout every step of the way. The team was actually amazing with everything they’ve done.
I couldn’t be happier with my smile and I will reconned anyone who is thinking of going to globe dentist should definitely consider it I can not thank them enuf they went above and beyond for me and made me feel very welcome and safe!

I have visited the Global Dental Centre in Antalya on two occasions to have dental implants.
Before coming here I was in contact with Charles who was my liason who was outstanding in explaining everything prior to my visit. On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth.

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

I have always been impressed by the state-of-the-art technology used by the clinic, which ensures efficient and accurate diagnoses and treatments. Additionally, the staff is friendly, efficient, and always go above and beyond to ensure their patients are satisfied with their experience.

Overall, I highly recommend Global dental center for any dental needs. They are truly committed to providing the highest level of care and treating their patients with the utmost respect and professionalism.

Big Thanks to all team !!! :)

Yours Aistijus  (Ice)

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step.

I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.

I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.

I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days.

The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received.

I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I have visited the Global Dental Centre in Antalya on two occasions to have dental implants.

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

I have always been impressed by the state-of-the-art technology used by the clinic, which ensures efficient and accurate diagnoses and treatments. Additionally, the staff is friendly, efficient, and always go above and beyond to ensure their patients are satisfied with their experience.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I have visited the Global Dental Centre in Antalya on two occasions to have dental implants.

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED

Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I have visited the Global Dental Centre in Antalya on two occasions to have dental implants.

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve
Lovely ladies and made me feel very comfortable

On arrival at the centre I was informed in depth about my procedures which were performed beyond reproach all the staff from cleaners to dentists were friendly and I cannot thank them enough.
I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.

As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

I would recovery Global Dental Centre to anyone they have reinstalled my confidence.
Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve
Lovely ladies and made me feel very comfortable

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

From routine checkups to more complex procedures, the dental professionals Global dental center are knowledgeable, skilled, and always put their patients first. They provide a welcoming and comfortable environment for all, making even the most nervous patients feel at ease.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best.

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.

As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything

I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received.

I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.

I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!
Never left a dentist so happy before, you get the best service with the best hospitality. really…Thank you all
The best in Antalya!!!
The best !
Brought my family to this dentist. It's been a wonderful experience

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.

As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.
England
Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!
Never left a dentist so happy before, you get the best service with the best hospitality. really…Thank you all

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work.

They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.

I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.

Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!

Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth.

I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Treatment start date 20/06/23

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!
Wow, what an amazing experience, they have the best doctors and dentist at design turkey! I can not recommend them enough! I have had zero pain, genuinely the best experience in a dentist Iv ever had! Thank you so much to the full team ❤️

I couldn’t recommend Dental Design enough, they have truly transformed my teeth, the treatment and care has been the best, they are so welcoming and made me feel at ease, I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to transform there smile :)
I came to make my teeth done here and they look absolutely amazing. They look super natural very amazing job. Now I know I can smile with more confidence. All thanks to my doctor and the nice staff
I recently had the pleasure of getting veneers done, and let me tell you, the results are beyond amazing!     

From the moment I stepped into the dental design, I was greeted with the warmest smiles and exceptional service. The staff made me feel so comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process. Their professionalism and attention to detail truly impressed me.   

Now, let's talk about the end result - WOW! My veneers have completely transformed my smile, and I couldn't be happier!

Thank you once again to the incredible team for their outstanding service and for giving me a smile that I'm proud to show off!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received.

The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.
England
Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!
Never left a dentist so happy before, you get the best service with the best hospitality. really…Thank you all
The best in Antalya!!!
The best !
Brought my family to this dentist. It's been a wonderful experience

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!
Never left a dentist so happy before, you get the best service with the best hospitality. really…Thank you all

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.

Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.

We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.

Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.
England
Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection

Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Absolutely brilliant I feel like a complete different person . The teeth have made me more confidence then ever. Can’t thank the dental design enough . Experience was absolutely fabulous will definitely recommend.

Thank you.
By far the best place.
I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!
Never left a dentist so happy before, you get the best service with the best hospitality. really…Thank you all

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

Joseph Michael Sweeney
Treatment start date 20/06/23
Thanks Perla Dental Centre, you gave me back my confidence when I smile and talk Orhan was helping me out with my transfer and booking. He also help me with all the translation during my treatment. Everything was as promised. Im thankful

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work.

They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.
Kesinlikle 5 yildizdan cok fazlasini hak ediyorlar.implant yaptirmak icin isvecten geldik havalimanindan bizi guleryuzle karsiladilar  transfer hotel  ilgi  mukemmeldi basta doktor sinan bey  ve saime hanim olmak uzere tum guleryuzlu nazik profosyonel calisanlarina cok tesekkur ediyorum islerini  titizlikle profosonelce  yapiyorlar  dis yaptirmak isteyenlere   siddetle tavsiye ediyorum
Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs .

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.

I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Alex.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.   I highly recommend them
So my first visit has gone very well. I am very happy with their service and kindness. I'm looking forward to returning to have my permanent teeth fitted.
A personal thank you to Raziye who has been amazing and put my mind at ease the whole way through. Also my surgeon Hakan and dentist Merve

From the initial contact to the final day the personal touches from the staff was brilliant, always ensuring the patients best interests come before profit. Always ensure you are comfortable and painless throughout. accommodation and transfers all sorted out and the staff (Shirren) was always on hand to answer any question via WhatsApp if required. Work was top class exactly what I was looking for. Again many thanks

Thank you so much
Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.
I am writing to highly recommend Global dental center for any dental services that may be required. As a patient of Global dental center for the past year, I can attest to the high quality of care provided by the team.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Just completed my final treatment at Oris Dental and the results are so much more amazing than I expected. Cannot praise or recommend them highly enough for the care and professionalism in how they treat their patients.
The best hospitality, staff are amazing. Everyone was lovely and helpful and made me feel welcome throughout the process. My teeth look amazing and I'm grateful for what the doctors did. I would definitely be recommending friends and family here as they just incredible with what they do!
Many thanks.
I really appreciate your interest and tolerance, very nice people Dr.Dervişhan and Dt.Nehir doctors really do their job very well. I was very pleased with the interest and interest of the staff in the dental treatment I had, healthy smiles with Oris.
Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .
This is the best dental clinic in Antalya. They managed to safe my teeth and the end result is fabulous. They take their time to make you feel relaxed, wonderfull staff!!!

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.

Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you

Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.

I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Bravo à l’équipe de Kotul Pour leur amabilité et leur professionnalisme, nous avons été pris en charge du début à la fin de notre séjour. En plus d’avoir pu  réaliser les implants à un prix plus que raisonnable, nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir visiter la magnifique ville d’Antalya. Que demander de plus? J’ai hâte d’y retourner pour la deuxième partie.
Hasta ile ilgi, alaka, güleryüz mükemmel. Tedavimin başlangıç ve bitimine kadar hep yanımda oldular. Profesyonel bir ekip ve çalışma. Tavsiye edebileceğim tek klinik. Herşey için teşekkür ederim
Tedavi sürecimde ilgi ve alakalarından çok memnun oldum, yaklaşık 1 senedir kontrollerime gidip geliyorum tedavi sonrası süreçte de çok profesyonel ve başarılılardı. Tüm çalışanlarına teşekkür ediyorum
Çok güzel ilgilendiler. Emre Bey'e ilgisinden dolayı ve korkularımı yenmemde yardımcı oldukları için çok teşekkür ederim. Gönül rahatlığıyla gidebilirsiniz.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing
I have been to antlara dental clinic in Antalya for my first course of treatment.ive always been very nervous about seeing the dentist in uk but the dentists and staff in antlara are wonderful.Yusuf,Berfin and Raziye were always there to help with any questions and communications through WhatsApp even at weekends.the dentists were the best,so patient and helpful even with me who was a nervous wreck..they made me feel so safe in their hands I can only thank them for being so kind and professional.my next appointment is in about 5 months when my implants have settled and my final zirconium crowns will be fitted and cant wait to see them all again.

I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.
Not being lover of the dentist I let me teeth go , so I decided a trip to turkey was needed to sort them out , I chose this place and was not disappointed they made me feel at eas as I was very nervous I had 6 implants , crowns fittted and teeth out , they were great I would recommend this dentist to anyone .

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!

Went for a simple descale and polish.

Fantastic work by the dentist, very thorough job and teeth are now much cleaner and white.

Price was fair

Great customer service from staff inside and Dannielle online.

However far too much bureaucracy and paperwork for the straightforward service we received. Needs simplifying and to go digital!

They were also quite pushy to take face pictures of me for their own marketing purposes - didn’t make it clear if I could opt out of this…
I feel really let down and disappointed in the treatment I have received.
Firstly- We have spoke about coming to dentakay for some time now and when we spoke with Leo the co-ordinator he gave us a price and told us that it wouldn’t change too much but it has gone up by thousands.
We had no choice but to pay as this is the only reason we flew to Antalya. To visit the dentist
Secondly - I then started treatment, i was under local anaesthetic and had all the teeth shaved down, i was told to have a seat and then an hour or so later they came back and told us we couldn’t continue treatment as planned because they were too busy and we had to come back the next day. We left with nothing, no pain killers, no paper work with some do’s or don'ts , no information, nothing at all. When we left I was still numb but as the night went on and it started to ease off I was in so much pain.
I was up all night and couldn’t sleep with the pain and it was so much worse when I lay down. We went back the next day and explained I was in pain. They offered a pain relief injection which helped. I was supposed to have root canal, extractions and implants.
Only the extractions and implants were done as that’s all they had time for and now I need to go back again the next day to be put under more Anaesthetic for the root canal’s to be done. Things that were supposed to be done on Monday still weren’t done by the Wednesday because they were too busy.
I have been in the clinic 6 days straight with no rest days.
We were handed medication on the Wednesday antibiotics and pain killers and then asked to pay for them. We didn’t know we had to pay and this was never explained to us at any point. I feel like we haven’t been given any after care advice.
After all the surgery over the last few days, I have no idea what i can or can’t eat or drink. I have had to google it for myself.
I think this is so unprofessional.
I was been fitted with temporary teeth and explained as soon as I saw them I didn’t like them, I showed them the kind of thing I was looking for and was told that was fine and whatever I wanted to change I can do that no problem until I was completely happy.
I had to pick the shape of the teeth from a crinkled piece of paper that looked like it had been lying around for months and the Shade from a single tooth on a stick.
Very very hard to pick something I need to keep in my mouth for a long time from things like this and feel it should have been done more professionally with more ways to show me how these were going to look.
The teeth were fitted today,
Shape is OK but the colour is way off.
Being told I could change them I went with the shade 3 Hollywood white.
The sample tooth was still very white and thought this would be good however they are not white at all and I feel they are yellow at the bottom near my gums, there is a few different shades on them.
When I spoke to the dentist about this he simple said NO they can’t be changed!
Very rudely!
I was told they could changed and his answer was they can be made darker but not lighter!
No one in the whole clinic ever told me this!
Otherwise I would have went shade 1 with possibly being able to change them.
Very very disappointed that I have paid ALOT of money and not happy at all
I left the clinic today with a few bits of paperwork but they forgot to give me my mouth guard that I need to wear so I’m waiting to see about this before I go home tomorrow on the hope I receive one.

I told the team I get married in June and this was the reason for my new teeth and I feel they have taken my excitement away by the horrible experience I was given.
I need to go back to have my implants done but I’m not sure I will return to dentakay after all of this.
There is no way to contact anyone at the Antalya clinic, it’s all done by the wats app chats but none of them work in Antalya they are all based in Istanbul so it takes a while to get a reply about ANYTHING.

I do have to say that JULIE at Antalya clinic is very very understanding and try's her best to help but a lot of things are out of her control.
Husband was taken care of as soon as you arrived.  They taken all teeth out, with sinus lift and bone graft. They look after you and the advice and care after is top.  They asked of we both wanted drinks (really recommended the caramel iced coffee ☕️) I so recommend these people as the care is top and so is the service.
First class, I went to the Antalya clinic which was very modern, full of the latest technology and had a very high standard of cleanliness. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the dental staff were very professional and knowledgeable. The taxi service was luxurious, always on time and nothing was a problem for them. The only negative was a lengthy waiting time at my first appointment which I had not been warned about by the staff. I would highly recommend this clinic for treatment, I am extremely happy with my teeth 10 out of 10
Had my teeth done back in March and everything was fantastic from start to finish. My actual final cost was less than I was quoted which was a surprise.
Had my teeth for four months now had absolutely no issues and everybody telling me how fantastic they look and I’m really pleased with the result and cannot say enough good things about this company and the service they supply
Was really worried at first, but the professionalism of the staff really put me at ease. I would recommend this company to anybody thinking of having their teeth done.
A life-altering experience for the better. I came to DCT Antalya to address several issues: old fillings, crowding, gaps, etc - many problems. In just a few days the incredible staff did miraculous work. If such a clean, high tech, beautiful dental clinic exists in the US I have not seen it - and couldn't afford it. Approx $9k total for 25 crowns, 3 implants, and 2 root canals (& bridges during implant healing months). The same in the US would cost over $50k. They provided a long menu of delicious juice and coffee beverages and lux hotel transportation, all without charge. Finally, one of the bosses, Oz, had a long conversation with me about my particular case, explaining everything and answering all my questions so patiently. The staff all worked together so efficiently, and were very gracious. Don't hesitate, get your dental work done here. Pic of the live olive tree in the patio
From first contact everything was easy. Every person in your dentist was a pleasure to deal with. They understood what I wanted and gave me the perfect smile. Thank you again, I would highly recommend your dentist.
I cannot recommend this dentist enough, my dentist was called Furkan Basar and he was amazing he was kind and thoughtful throughout the process and he speaks very good English also. I am never using another dentist in the UK, i would rather fly here and see Furkan as he will put you first and what you want. The technology is amazing and i had 25 crown veneers and i felt no pain. Again thanks to the Dental Centre Turkey and a big Thank you Furkan Basar for making my perfect smile and i now feel
Confident to smile with my teeth showing.
Terrible dentists! I did two root canals, now I have to see a specialist because they did not do it correctly, did not do any X-rays when they finished with the root canal. Be careful, big scam. Mouth got infected both times which caused my to take antibiotics. Pay the extra money and stay where you are!
There was no pushy overselling.
I wasn't persuaded to go for the biggest option of work done, but was given the time to work through the plan that best suited my mouth. This actually meant spending quite a bit less than I had expected, I wasn't made to feel guilty that my work was less expensive. When you have travelled alone these things are terribly important. As a result I have recommended this dentist a lot.

I have had a nice experience with Queen Dental in Antalya. The team was welcoming,  professional and dedicated. Transportation was seamless to and from the clinic. Dentists, reception, and driver were polite.  The implant was done as described even though my gum didn’t make the task easier. I might go back again for a review session when time permits. If you want to get a good dental work at an affordable price, I recommend this place.
Special thanks to Ismat, Ali, Burhan, Tugce and Merve.
Tesekkur ederim.
Hamza.
Very friendly staff, dentist very professional and takes their time and no rush you at all. They have reasonable fixed prices and do brilliant job. Highly recommended. Happy customer and I should visit again. Thank you
It's a clinic where the most successful dentist of Antalya work. From the moment i set foot at Antalya airport, I felt the professionalism. The hotel is tremendous. I felt very safe. Thank you to the whole team.
Very accommodating and welcoming. They have an an amazing expert surgeon and dentists. Drivers and translators are very friendly. Great clinic, very clean. I absolutely recommend this dental clinic.. keep up the good work guys! Kudos to you all
Hello, I would like to tell you about my experience, first of all I was impressed with the service, from the moment I set foot in the airport to the last procedure, I was met at the airport by a wonderful staff who escorted me to the clinic, a polite responsible person with excellent driving skills, I was amazed by his professionalism.  As for the procedures, I received excellent quality service at an ideal price. I knew exactly what I wanted and I introduced it to the staff. I got exactly the result I expected. thank everything
This is the most amazing dental clinic I have ever been to. The staff are warm and friendly as well as professional! They make you want to come to your dentist!!
I had problems with my teeth, I changed crowns several times, they were crooked and ugly. My friend advised me Dental Centre Turkey Queen in Antalya Turkey. I was very pleased. The dentists are professionals, excellent staff. And the free hotel was a bonus!
Hi I have to say they are all exceptionally amazing all the staff. From the driver to the receptionist to the dental nurses and the cosmetic dentist are perfectionists. My teeth are amazing. They do everything from picking you up from the airport. Taking you to a hotel which they paid for. Pick you up for every appointment then take you back to your hotel. After they finish their amazing dental work they take you back to the airport. All I can say they are the queens of dentistry. If you need any dental work don’t hesitate dental centre turkey queen for me are the best. And the best thing I left till last the price is soo much cheaper than in uk you will be amazed by the price this I guarantee you. Anyway thank you so much to everyone at dental queen   Oh just one more thing their new clinic is so ultra clean so stylist it’s a pleasure to walk into
An amazing experience.  Very friendly staff.  Excellent service from the day we contacted them to being met at the airport and at the clinic.  The sentence exceeded our expectations.  I recommend
I cannot contact the clinic. no one answers phone calls, SMS, messengers and e-mails

Amazing clinic with very kind, caring and professional staff. Lady called Ilke was an  absolut angel throughout the process. She gave my husband consultation online, explained everything, guided him while in Turkey, was super helpful, understanding and supportive since he has needle fear and is dyslexic. She made us feel comfortable and at ease.
Biggest thank You to all Your team one more time. Will be recommending Your clinic to all our  friends and clients.

Kind regards,
M and L Morrison
The teeth whitening process put my husband in a lot of pain after it, the results of the 2 sessions combined at 40 mins were not as effective as advertised in their photo. Almost looks like unreal photos used on their pages, there was also some bleeding from his gums, the first photo is the before photo on the same day, the 2 after are straight after the teeth whitening process. Better teeth whitening in London and cheaper, avoid if you can.
I am extremely pleased with the results I achieved! The staff at the clinic are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the clinic itself is impeccably clean. I am definitely planning on returning for more treatments in the future xx
My experience from the start was good. The dentists and management were extremely excellent. I and my wife had a total of 12 fillings and 4 crowns and done perfect. The interpreter named ilke looked after us from start to finish very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic.
I have just gotten 24 crowns done, and i couldn’t be more happy. This clinic made me feel comfortable and safe about the decision, as they are most certainly experts in the industry, and are able to answer any question or concern. Coming from Canada, people will tell you to steer away from visiting clinics in foreign countries like this, but i can assure you that the dentist’s at this clinic are just as good, if not better then any dentist i have been to in Canada. With their package deal they provided accommodation and transportation from airport, hotel, and clinic, which was a huge plus. If you are looking to get crowns or veneers done i would highly recommend coming here as you won’t find a better service for the price. Everyone was super friendly from the translator, dentist’s, assistants, and receptionist. Thank you again Dental Clinic Turkey!
Professional and the best Dental Clinic.
I have witnessed and enjoyed services of dentists with highest level of expertise.
100% hygiene
100% perfection
100% customer service and comfortable service.
100% customer satisfaction
The supporting staff are with great understanding , caring and responsible.
Wonderful experience,  value for money.... Exceptional services.
Happy smiles       

I recommend.
I had a great experience with this clinic. From the beginning to the end the clinic provides  a warm hospitality and care. The clinic also provides a hotel and a transfer from airport to the hotel , to the clinic and back to the airport.The accommodation is in a walking distance from the clinic, which is very helpful in case if you need to discuss anything with clinic staff. The dentist and surgeon are very professional, quick and attentive. I have 28 all zirconium crowns  and 4 implants been done in 4 days at this clinic and I am very happy with the result! Will be back in a five months to finish the dental work due to implants healing time. I highly recommend this clinic to everyone who’s looking for  a trustworthy dentists who can take care of your teeth and a beautiful “million dollar” smile! Marina Rhoads
I would like to recommend this highly professional clinic in Antalya, I was worried at first , cause there is so many to choose from , but after getting in touch with clinics  coardination team , my worries disappeared. They are very professional and reassured that any needs I might have they will be able to help me and created treatment plan tailored to my individual needs . Its fairly  small clinic and everyone is treated and looked after very well to compare with similar but much bigger clinics. In Dental Clinic Antalya  they are after quality not quantity, they make sure that you leave clinic satisfied and happy . My dentist was truly master of his craft and offered different treatmnents and options to suit my needs and financial possibilities. Will definitely come back soon .Thank you
I came over from Philadelphia and the process was extremely smooth from the online consultation to completion! The staff was very friendly and the dentist had extreme attention to detail. You already know how cost effective it was compared to the US and the results are life changing. Don’t hesitate to get a new smile with them. During the week I explored Antalya and its beauty and left with a perfect smile. You can’t beat that!
finished the first stage of treatment with Dental Clinic Antalya. Came from LONDON .My next visit will be in four or five months later. It was a great experience for me. The experienced and responsible medical team,  most importantly was for me the expertise and honesty of the surgeon، I noticed the surgeon's expertise and skill in implant placement.Because I had the experience of having implants in the past.The clinic is very modern and clean ,The management of receiving treatment services between the patient and the clinic was very precise and without any time wastage. And of course, my translator was compassionate and responsible during the first stage in four days. and HOTEL I had a good time because it was very clean ، next to the beautiful beach of Antalya,t and the staff were polite I really enjoyed being there.
I personally recommend to my friends and family who need dental treatment GET IT IN DENTAL CLINIC ANTALYA

I have stayed in the same hotel with other pacients from other clinics . Dental design is by far above all of them.
Life changing . The staff is amazing and the quality of the products they use and the service they provide is just brilliant.
Thanks for making my life great again ❤️
Truly brilliant experience from start to finish. Was very nervous at first as first time travelling abroad to get my teeth fixed but best decision I made. The practice itself was impeccably tidy and had high tech equipment. The dentist was very knowledgeable and experienced. The staff were 10/10. So happy I chose Dental Design Turkey. Will definitely returning for more work. Thank you so much.
From my initial point of contact last year the service I have received from Dental Design has been unbelievable, all questions via WhatsApp before landing were answered within the hour and I was kindly met at the airport by the friendly driver. The building is extremely clean and every person you meet is kind and friendly. I was treated by Fadime who is absolutely amazing at what she does. She made sure I was always comfortable and pain-free..  constantly reassuring me and making me feel good. The aftercare has been great and I'm so glad I went with Dental Design. I can't recommend them enough and will return for further work in future. Thank you again you have changed my life and I will be forever thankful
I got my 20 crowns a month ago now and I could not be happier with my decision to choose the team at Dental Design Turkey to do the work. From the moment I walked in the whole staff was professional, understanding, kind, and friendly. I had complete confidence in Doctor Hamide and Doctor Fadime. They explained everything, answered all of my questions, and they were completely aboveboard about everything, and trustworthy. I cannot recommend Dental Design highly enough! 5 stars for everything! Thank you all so much!

Excellent dentist , friendly , efficient and extremely Professional .  The team put you at easy and offer a VIP experience. I would recommend to everyone!

Medical Antalya is the best dental clinic. They changed my dental crown in the upper part, they put 2 implants in the lower part and they put the dental crown in the lower part. They changed all my teeth. I am very happy.  Now I have a Hollywood smile.  I had a VIP transfer from the airport to the clinic and from the hotel to the clinic, transfer to the airport back home. All employees were very kind, doctors, assistants, drivers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You're the best.  I recommend you with all my heart!
Hello I just wanted to share my amazing experienced at MEDIC ANTALYA. Highly recommended! MY DENTIST was superb and very friendly Man and he was very patient to me, he’s assistant was really good and pretty ladies. Also The owner of the medic Antalya was really good all through my procedures. Also All the staffs are amazing, the dental clinic was stunning clean and spotless!, They done a good job. I am beyond happy to my new SMILE They work so hard to make all the patients are satisfied with big smile after their visits. Thank you very much for the amazing 3 days of my holiday I really enjoyed it guys. I hope I can see you all again so soon with my family and friends. The free hotel was amazing and my driver was very good, all the staffs are speaks English very well. Perfect stars ✨ to all of the good working staffs at MEDIC ANTALYA I love you all. May God bless you all! Have a blessed day!! I superb love my teeth thank you again!
Medic antayla was highly recommended to me by a friend, and my friend wasn’t wrong! I accompanied my son who had zirconium crowns. We were picked up to and from all appointments by their very friendly and professional driver, and in between appointments we had a lovely holiday. The clinic is beautiful and exceptionally clean all the staff were absolutely wonderful to us, made us feel at ease straight away with their fantastic communication and hospitality they made the whole process a really good experience and after all that my son is over the moon with his new teeth. Thank you medic antayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am part way through my treatment with Medic Antalya for some implants from broken teeth and a bridge to having the rest of the teeth fitted with crowns.
Very slick and professional team. Immediately identified I would need a bone graft due to a former infection obtained from an extraction with my UK dentist.
The surgeon Hakan Ajman immediately gowned up and my mouth and surrounding cheeks applied with brown antiseptic solution. I just couldn’t help comparing with UK practices that are so Neanderthal and slow in comparison both in equipment and ease of dentistry practice!
The head dentist, Dr Ishak Can; a suave, charismatic character who kept popping in to watch (showing he was passionately interested in my work) and we joked about comparing motorbikes!
I had a few implants placed in as well as an extraction and all was professionally stitched up.
I left with a doggy bag of horse sized antibiotics (something I was never given in the UK apart from told to use salt water), painkillers and anti inflammatory tablets. Didn’t need the latter two as I then returned a few days later having had no pain or discomfort to having a set of temporary teeth fitted that will last for four months by Rasih, the other dentist.
All supported by the kind and giggly nurses Rukiye and Yildiz who were so sweet and funny.
And nothing would stop me from mentioning the main lady Sebnem, who was the patient co-ordinator - a sassy, confidant, pretty and kind lady who made sure everything ran smoothly.
When you arrive, you’re offered drinks and kindness and very clear explanations and with the characters of all the above, I was made to feel supported and confidant in my choice. A family environment and personal touch which you would never get in some of the biggest more commercial conveyor-style dentistry practices. I have made friends and cannot wait to see them all again in November!
Great staff, great doctors, great hotel staff, great vip transfers and great customer service my flights where cancelled phoned them up late at 9 oclock at night they where happy to assist me. Made sure i got to my airport, the detail they put into my crowns is 10 out pf 10 highly reccomend using medic antalya was mext to nothong in paon aswell they definetly look after there clients
Amazing clinic really helped me find my smile, very welcoming
I would like to once again thank Medic Antalya clinic with all my heart. A year after my first ever visit I can enjoy my amazing Hollywood smile. Although I wasn’t the easiest situation, Dr Hakan Akman completed my bone graft operation and implants with full success and Dr Zahid Seferli created my beautiful smile. I couldn’t forget about the entire team who helped and accompanied all my visits. I would like to thank assistants Rukiye and Yildis for the amazing atmosphere and care. Whilst our stay with my wife we always had the best care from reception thanks to Ogulcan. Everyone was very polite and sympathetic and the reception team always helpful and warm towards us. Special thanks also to Cem, Mete, Neslihan, Irem and Cenk. Even the transport from hotel to the clinic was amazing, very polite and safe with the driver Mehmeds making each journey that little bit better with his conversations. The whole responsibility of keeping in contact and organising all visits as well as making sure I am feeling good was thanks to Idil, my coordinator. Amazing and warm person who is always available when the patient needs her. Always cared about our happiness and we never felt like we were left to figure things out on our own. Overall I can say I cannot imagine doing my teeth at any other clinic as this clinic’s team is committed to the patient unlike many other clinics. In my eyes Medic Antalya is the number one place to go for your teeth. 100% recommend
I would like to share my brilliant experience at MedicAntalya with everyone. I researched a lot of clinics before deciding to choose MedicAntalya as they were the only clinic who expressed concern about my type 2 diabetes and explained in depth why they were concerned more about me and my health than getting the business for themselves! I was looked after so well on my two visits in September 2022 and January 2023 I have no words to put across how grateful I am for the care and attention I received all of the wonderful staff who gave me my dream come true smile xx special thanks to Ceyda and Cem who kept me informed 24/7 and took time out to answer any questions and concerns I had. I cannot thank you all enough, from transfers to and from the airport to hotel and clinic, to the hotel staff and the amazing team who looked after me so well xx
I would 100% recommend MedicAntalya to anyone!!
Best experience I could have had from start to finish!  The whole procedure is very easy.  All you have to do is contact the clinic, send photos of your teeth, and then an online consultation, pricing and cost of the dental procedure follow.  Transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the dentist are included in the cost of the treatments, as well as the hotel stay + breakfast.  Great place heart of Lara Beach.  The procedure itself is very quick, stress-free and pain-free.  I am incredibly happy with my new smile!  Teeth made of the highest quality materials, natural porcelain color.  I would never go back to my natural teeth before the treatment. Full professionalism and experienced dentists, the most friendly staff ever! I highly recommend!!
medic antalya, the best place in antalya to do any surgical procedure related to teeth, high quality care, the best costumer service from start to finish, very kind staff at all times asking if I felt comfortable and happy with my teeth , size and color, I really recommend medic antalya without any doubt to any friend or family, I feel like a different person and I am very happy with my result, once again thank you to all the professionals at medic antalya for the great experience you gave me

I love my experience here. The doctor was so nice. There was a sign saying my name when I arrived at the airport. I came from Houston, Texas. They took me to my hotel with their fancy transport. Their coordinator Muhammad was easy to understand and very nice. He told me the entire process and quote. Everything was understood with ease. Yasmin was also very sweet. I'm so glad I chose to come here for a better price than other places. I recommend this place to anyone to get their teeth done. I love my zirconium crowns. I have the smile of my dreams thanks to kotul dental center.
I contacted this dental center while I was on my Antalya trip . I applied to convert 12 of my teeth into zirconium teeth. They responded quickly and made my reservation. All the dentists at the dental center were very professional and helped me with even the smallest care and treatment before doing my teeth. I recommend this professional service to everyone
Absolutely amazing experience. I cannot put into words how much the people at kotuls helped me. I feel a different person now and would recommend that anyone needing help or embarrassed by their smile contact kotuls it will change your life. My only regret is I should of done this years ago . Thank you to everyone at kotuls .
They deserve more than 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended
Je recommande vivement la clinique Kotul Dental Center!!!  Ils sont d’un professionnalisme, doux et à l’écoute. J’ai eu droit à un service exceptionnel et un travail bien fait. Leur priorité est la satisfaction du patient.
L’équipe est sympathique et souriante, on se sent en famille.

Nothing short of AMAZING!    I went to  Premium Dental turkey for my full smile transformation. I was received at the airport with their transportation services free of charge, to and from each appointment. I am forever grateful and thankful for the team at premium dental. They went above and beyond! The entire team and staff were very caring and accommodating, dentists were thorough and professional throughout the entire process explaining everything to me making sure I understood every step. I felt in great hands    definitely recommend PDT if you are looking to get some work done.  I left feeling confident with my new smile
Impecable 5* Service from all of the Team at PDT   .. I’m so pleased I chose these guys & gals    ~ they’ve not only gave me an awesome smile.. most importantly, they’ve given me my confidence back.

I feel amazing   

Thank You Premium Dental Turkey
I am delighted with my teeth and the professional and friendly ambience of the clinic. My entire new set of teeth are absolutely stunning and very comfortable. My Dentist in London is so impressed with the work he is referring patients to the clinic. Oceans of love and thanks for looking after me and giving me a smile I always wanted. Simin
I recently had veneers done at Premium Dental and I can confidently say that they did an excellent job. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality dental work. The staff was amazing - thoughtful, friendly, and attentive. Special thanks to Maddy, the patient coordinator, who took care of all the logistics, including airport pickup/dropoff and transportation to their office every day. She is extremely good at her job and really ensures that your experience there is premium. The drivers were never late, and always friendly, which made the trip so stress-free.

A special thank you to Dr. Ismail who completely transformed my teeth. He not only fixed my smile, but it felt like he gave me a new outlook on life and the confidence I was missing. His attention to detail and expertise is truly impressive. The office itself was the epitome of luxury - beyond clean and modern, it truly represented the premium experience they promised. Overall, my experience at Premium Dental was outstanding and I would refer them to everyone. Thank you for the great work and exceptional service!
I recommend this clinic because after 10 years of waiting I can enjoy a perfect smile.
I can say that I am a person who is afraid of doctors, but Mady and the entire team of doctors were so patient with me that I ended up feeling very comfortable when I went for treatment.
So if someone wants perfect teeth, I recommend Premium Dental Turkey
The Clinic received me very well, and the whole Team including the drivers were extremely Professional. My Procedure was done in only 4 Days, and the Team had to Work extra Late just so I can get my veneers in time. I can only recommend this Clinic, They will really take good care of you throughout the whole Procedure. I would highly recommend getting your Veneers or Crowns at this Clinic.
I went to PDT recently for a full treatment and I couldn’t be more happy!
All the personnel were super friendly and very professional.
Any doubt or fear was completely gone after the first minute.
I got 24 zirconium crowns and my teeth never looked this good.
For anyone that wants a complete makeover and a perfect smile should definitely visit.
I admire their professionalism, their thoroughness in explaining dental procedures and approachability should you have any questions. But what really stands out is their caring demeanour. It’s a quality that is rare and helps to make you feel that you’re in good hands.  Gloria Thomas, writer, children books - London
A+++ for the team and job undertaken! I had 8 upper and 8 lower crowns put on last year september, it is now 1 year past and they are still in same perfect condition! The staff from transfer to actual dental treatment is amazing, everybody makes you feel as part of a family, they look after you like you are VIP       my dentist was Dr. Aras. I had them checked at my local private dentist back in UK and they confirmed that the job is done perfectly! Don’t hesitate to use Premium dental clinic, they are best for such important life changing make over!
My Premium Dentel review:
I had my treatment back in July, I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing my review to give a full roundup of my experience.

Contact prior to travelling: Excellent.
By email and WhatsApp, the contact was superb, all questions were answered and explained, I felt total confidence in what the process would be when we arrived.

I decided to book a 10 day TUI holiday so that I was having a trip as well as my treatment.
Mum and I arrived at the airport and the surgery has arranged for transfers to take us to the hotel, this is a nice touch that they offer.
The following day we were picked up at the agreed time and taken to the surgery:
Monday: This is the long day, we were greeted by Maddi, she was extremely friendly, helpful and informative.
Then the dentists (all 3 of them) examined me, they consulted each other and then Maddi explained the results, the treatments and cost, I was very impressed that they quoted me what treatment would be best for me and not the most expensive.
Mum was shown to the very nice waiting room and my treatment started, the filling of the teeth, this was quite harrowing, it wasn’t painful due to the injections, it is loud and long, what helps is the hygienist and dentist were very attentive, after hours of filing you wait for you temporary teeth.
When they come they feel a little odd however you’re just grateful to leave and go back to the hotel at this point.
I was quite nervous about eating so I stuck to soft foods, but I believe I would have been ok with most things, these teeth were ok but feel a little awkward.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: I went back for my fittings, everyday we were met by Maddi who continued to be helpful and supportive.
The dentist was excellent, he explained everything he was doing as he did it.
He was a complete perfectionist, which made me fell secure.

Inserting the implants was the most painful day, this is due to the injections and procedure, following this I found it really difficult to get used to my face, I looked completely different, seeing myself in photos freaked me out, however I am now used to my new smile and I LOVE IT, I’ve had great feedback from friends and colleagues.

I had discomfort and sensitivity for about 1 month following, I also had bleeding for a couple of weeks, this stopped when started using Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash.

Overall, it was a wonderful service, extremely professional, very clean and worth every penny.

I 100% recommend Dental Support turkey . They are a perfect team who work with professionalism and take care about everything what patient needs . I had a perfect holiday and a perfect smile all  in one week. Don’t hesitate to contact them for the best for your teeth. And the most important 100% no pain , I had 5 implants and the next day I could eat without problems and do all my normal activities . I’m happy to smile again with their help
I had my implants and crowns made at Dental Support Turkey. all care and guidance is good, you are picked up from the airport by their shuttle and every day from the hotel you are taken back and forth to their clinic, you get different fittings of crowns. you will be warmly welcomed. Dr. Serhat and Dr. Berna , Dr Halill Ibrahim really did a nice job. you get a perfect smile
Hi,just wanted to share my experience with detal support turkey.I had some dental work done whilst i was away for  a few days. The hotel they reserved for  me was absolutely fabulous.There  service was outstanding. The team were very friendly and. Supportive.  The  after care is brilliant .i like how they check up on you with phone calls and messages. I would recommend DST 100%.
Today today I did my first visit for my implants took 4 days to finish and today I feel way better and I look  way better without teeth and I'm very satisfied with the great job they did to my teeth they were very friendly and professional I recommend them to any one who needs implant. Look at my picture and let speak  for it self they did a great job.
Where do I even start! From the first day we talked to Dr Serhat, he was so kind and informative and answered every question of mine with sincerity.
The day we arrived from toronto we met Lily, who had come to pick us up at the airport and also met Dr serhat and immediately we could tell that we are in good hands. From the transport to the accommodation to our experience with the clinic, everything was 5 stars.
The next day the car came to pick us up to go to the dental clinic and wow! It is such a clean environment  and there we were met with all other doctors who without wasting any time started with xrays, and we were then explained exactly what our treatment plan would be and how much it would cost. Anytime we had a question was answered with honesty.
Both my husband and myself opted for the "Hollywood smile" package with zirconium crowns.

We are very happy with our outcome, and we Thank all the doctors, with a big shout out to Dr serhat and Lily. we surely recommend the creative dental clinic for any small or big dental work you have. This is the place! You will not be disappointed.
As a dentist myself, I recently had the opportunity to receive canal treatment and filling services from the Dental Support Turkey team, and I must say, I am extremely satisfied with the level of care I received. The entire process was carried out with utmost professionalism and precision. The team demonstrated exceptional expertise and attention to detail throughout the canal treatment, ensuring optimal results. The fillings I received were of high quality, seamlessly blending with my natural teeth. I highly recommend Dental Support Turkey for their exceptional dental services and commitment to patient satisfaction.
I recently received dental support in Turkey, including fillings and teeth cleaning services, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of care I received. The staff was professional, attentive, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The dental fillings were expertly done, and the teeth cleaning was thorough and left my teeth feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking dental treatment in Turkey.
I am delighted with the service and professionalism of the staff at CREATIVE Smiles Turkey!!!!! The entire treatment was quick and painless. I recommend this clinic to everyone!!! I will definitely come again!!!!
Everything was smooth, I got support, communication. Great team, professional. I did not feel any pain after the dental treatment. I will also treat my teeth at this clinic in the future
I recently had a smile makeover with laminate veneers, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The process was smooth and well-coordinated, thanks to the skilled and knowledgeable dental team. The laminate veneers have completely transformed my smile, giving me a natural-looking and beautifully aligned set of teeth. The attention to detail and precision in crafting each veneer was remarkable. I am now more confident than ever, and I can't stop smiling! If you're considering a smile design with laminate veneers, I highly recommend it for a stunning and life-changing transformation.

This is one the places where the reviews speaks for itself. My mom needed a dental surgery and the staff here were exceptional in understanding our needs and wants. They care about their clients and will go above and beyond to ensure you get what you pay for. I’m sure it might be cheaper elsewhere but if you’re looking for quality and are coming from the US or Europe and wanna save at least 50% from what you’d be paying there, this is the place. Hotels and transportation is included
Amazing experience!! The orthodontic clinic that I visited in my own  country did not have enough experiences with teeth that have had trauma or injury, which was my case. So, my doctor in my country suggested me to find another doctor who has experiences with that. I am really lucky that I find Perla clinic, because the doctors there have very different kind of experiences, they are professional and very trustable. They offered me a solution which was saving my own problematic tooth, but also achieved the aesthetic result that I wished for. Actually at the end the result was better than I even expected at the beginning. A doctor in my own country offered a solution which would destroy half of my own front tooth and replace it with fake, it would also have been very expensive.
In Perla the doctor saved my natural tooth, I got a very beautiful smile now and I also saved thousands of euros, so I am really happy that I found Perla!
The servce there is also good, I felt welcome and taken care of each time I went there. They work also in English, German and Russian, so it was very comfortable for me. From my personal experience I can also recommend their beauty services.
I add 2 photos of my teeth before and 2 photos of how they look now.
Hi I travelled from U.K. alone as a woman aged 59 and never travelled alone before I was naturally a little nervous but thanks to Maly sorting all my transfers hotel and treatment I didn’t need to be thank you so much to Maly and an amazing team of doctors and hotel staff felt more like a dream holiday than medical treatment  I am having a full smile make over with implants in beautiful Antalya thanks to the very clever wonderful doctor  Maly speaks perfect English and very helpful so if you want to combine a beautiful holiday and come back with a beautiful smile don’t hesitate fully recommend perla I am so happy I went and can’t wait to return in July   Thank you for reading this review can’t praise them enough       ❤️
We can say that it is the best dental hospital in Antalya, they work in the most clean and meticulous way. The employees are always smiling and interested, if you have a mouth and dental problem, I strongly recommend it to everyone.
note: don't get me wrong, they are not my relatives, spouses, friends and acquaintances
Just completed the two visits we needed for dental treatment. The whole process went so smoothly. The staff were professional and friendly. From the airport pick up to the final drop off, I never thought dental work could almost be enjoyable   . Orhan was great from start to finish , answering every call and being there whenever I had additional questions or concerns. Thank you so much
AVOID….AVOID …..AVOID ….GUARANTEES WORTHLESS
Dr Tahsin Dayaniçlier was my dentist at
Perla Oral Clinic and want to sincerely thank him for his patience as I’ve a bad back and could not sit still in the chair for more than 5 mins, on top of that the end result is quality and am very happy to recommend him and the clinic.
Big thanks to him and all the team at Perla.
Gary
Unfortunately now need to change this as my bridge broke a week later and they wanted to charge me again which was my third visit and 3rd lot of charges .
NOT TO BE TRUSTED
AVOID
Just had full dental treatment completed at Perla, all the staff were extremely helpful and professional and made me feel at comfort at all times. I had 12 implants and 24 zirconium crowns and the work carried out was to the highest order, I’m extremely happy with my new teeth and I would highly recommend Perla.
I recently had dental implant surgery at Perla Implantology Center and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Not only were the doctors and staff highly skilled and knowledgeable, but they also provided exceptional care throughout the process. Their attention to detail and professionalism made me feel comfortable and confident with my decision to choose them for my treatment. After going through the entire procedure, I can confidently say that Perla Implantology Center is the best implant clinic in Turkey. If you're looking for a trusted team of experts to handle your oral health needs, look no further than Perla Implantology Center!
I started researching and contacting several dental clinics in Antalya on 06/04/23
From the very first WhatsApp communication with Thomas at Perla I felt very comfortable and confident about using this clinic. Thomas is a fantastic communicator and answers all questions with total clarity on WhatsApp and organised airport pick up via VIP transfer and then all other transfers from the hotel to the clinic.

The clinic itself is incredible and is obviously fully equipped with the latest technology and the cleanliness in the whole practice is first class.

The thing that stood out most was the staff at Perla. They were all amazing and I have never experienced customer service and care like it anywhere in the UK from any industry. It truly is a level above and 5 star rating does not do them justice. My treatment was extensive and I was treated by various different doctors as they have specialists for each different procedure and the doctors are constantly communicating with each other to ensure each task is performed to the highest level. I had 7 implants, 2 extractions, 4 root canal treatments, gum treatment, bone treatment, 21 zirconium crowns (7 to follow in December) and each of the nurses were fantastic. The different doctors were exceptional and of course Thomas is there all the time reassuring answering questions and generally taking care of me.

This treatment (first visit)was completed in the space of 7 days and I am extremely happy I chose Perla. The 7 implants need time to heal and I will return in December to have these crowned. I am still in communication with Thomas and he is organising myself and my wife’s hotel stay for the second visit which is included in the overall price.

I am delighted I chose Perla and highly recommend them due to the fantastic staff at the clinic. The whole team at Perla are amazing and they obviously place high importance on customer care from the helpful drivers, reception staff, admin staff, kind nurses, amazing doctors and of course the fantastic Thomas who puts it all together.

It’s fair to say I highly recommend Perla and I am looking forward till December to complete my treatment.

Kind Regards

My experience of Attelia has been nothing short of AMAZING!!

From the first pick-up at the airport back in January, everything has been run like clockwork and so precisely on time.

My first visit in January was to get the implants inserted and this was all done perfectly - the aftercare was also just superb!

The second visit to have the crowns fitted has also gone just as the first visit did; All gone to clockwork and on time.

The teeth I have had inserted look and feel great, I couldn't have asked for a bettwr experience or service.

My coordinator Kagan and specialist Ozer on the second visit have been absolutely great; They have made sure I have felt comfortable and informed throughout the whole process.

Conclusion from myself:

If you want to have work done on your teeth and are apprehensive or have any worries, choose ATTELIA and they will meet all your expectations and more!!     ❤️
Dear Attelia, thank you so much for another amazing experience at the clinic. All the staff here make the experience so much nicer and for sure the new Bar area is a great addition, especially if you have to spend all day here.
It truly is the best dental clinic in the world and I have recommended many to come to Attelia to get their perfect smile. All have said how amazing everyone is and the overall experience is so great.
Keep up the amazing work and see you in a few months for my implants.
Take care until then.
Well …. Not sure where to start. First of all I don’t like travelling or leaving home very much never mind skipping off to another country so far away for dental work.
I must also say that I am working class, I’m not used to investing money in my looks.
So how do you pick a clinic. My choice and I believe most people’s choice was purely based on knowing someone that has been here before.
I mean it, and I’m also not much of a “reviewer” …… this place, this service, they staff ….. everything just feels comfortable.
The professionalism, the cleanliness, the friendliness ……. It just all flows!
I’ve never enjoyed the dentists and sure who does. I thought this would be my last horrendous dentist visit …….. but for the first time in my life I felt comfortable here.
It runs so smoothly ……. Like a boat through water …….. and I like boats ….. a lot!
From the initial contact with Attelia, their professionalism has been consistently impressive. I was promptly provided with a comprehensive plan detailing the procedures, ensuring transparency and clarity. The experience continued to exceed expectations as I was chauffeured in a luxurious car upon my arrival at the airport, with punctual pick-ups every day.

The meticulous organization extended to providing my appointment times a day in advance, leaving no room for dissatisfaction. The dental expertise at Attelia is truly world-class, creating an environment where one feels secure and heard, addressing any concerns with utmost care.

Throughout my stay, my interpreter played a pivotal role in ensuring I remained well-informed and content with every aspect of the process. I am now elated to have achieved the smile I had long desired, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Attelia's role in making it a reality.

I wholeheartedly recommend Attelia to anyone seeking dental work at an affordable price without compromising on a top-notch, professional service. Thank you, Attelia, for transforming the smile I dreamt of into a reality.
Great service, very high tech and modern clinic. Burak and Selvi was great at communicating each stage of the treatment and in regards to travelling. I have had four fillings done and descale and polish. The snack and drinks are all for free too. Place looks amazing! You get a copy of the treatment in a Attelia bag at the end. ONLY issue is you may have to wait for the taxi for a bit as you have to bug the information desk about the taxi timing. I just hope the fillings stay all intact.
Amazing dental clinic in turkey, can’t speak highly enough about it. Best experience I’ve ever had at a dental clinic, everybody is so friendly and professional. Exceptional standards. I’d also like to give a special mention to Can and his assistant. Can is a fantastic dentist with unreal attention to detail and a perfectionist who wanted the finished job to be of the highest standard. Thank you.
Amazing. From you walk in the door everyone is friendly and attentive.  A very professional clinic.  I had 4 extractions for my first visit.  It was virtually painless.  The attention to detail and explanation of the treatment this and future visit was thorough.  I can't recommend enough. Would definitely recommend.  I will be attending this clinic for all future dentistry. The premises is modern and clean.
Dear Attila Clinic Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to you all for the exceptional dental care that I recently received at your clinic.
From the moment I walked through your doors, I was met with nothing but kindness and professionalism. Your staff made me feel comfortable and well-informed about every aspect of my treatment. The attention to detail, patience, and genuine care exhibited by each team member did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.
I would like to extend a special thank you to the doctor who treated me. Their expertise and skill have truly made a difference in my life. My teeth have never felt better, and I am so thankful for the work they did.
Implantologist Mr Hamit and my translator and coordinator Selvi
I also appreciated the clinic's clean and welcoming environment, which made my visits much more comfortable than I could have anticipated.
Your dedication to your patients' health and well-being is apparent in every interaction, and I feel fortunate to have been under your care. Thank you once again for the incredible work you all do.

Best Regards,

Pop Andrei Ioan
By far the best dentist I have ever visited with the best equipment and facilities. Same excellent treatment and hospitality as usual as we completed my treatment, as planned, 6 months after it began.  My coordinator Kagan and dentist Ahmet listened carefully to all my questions and took me through the process step by step. Highly recommended.
Very happy with my veneers. I found Attelia on Youtube. The treatment itself went well. There was no language issue; all staff members were able to understand and accommodate my dental requests. Even when I needed smaller tweaks to my veneers the dentist, assistants, and designer/artist was patient. The treatment recommended to me was also well explained. The hotel arrangement and transportation was well organized. The office itself was also very modern and clean. I had the privilege to be the patient of Dr. Derya Parpar & I got to meet the very knowledgeable Professor Siddik from University of Antalya. I got the natural look, with rounded edges to my teeth to make them look more youthful.

This is my second visit now to this clinic. I can honestly say the whole experience from start to finish has been amazing. Every member of staff do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.
On arrival my first day I was greeted by a young lady called Raziye wit the sort of smile you want to leave with. You will definitely not be disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone. Also the accommodation they put you in and all the transfers are great   . If you are thinking of getting any dental treatment you won't do better.
Just had the best experience, everybody is so friendly and kind, all team help to me in every second. I can smile again thanks to them, highly recommend this clinic.  My patient coordinator Raziye explained everything make me feel comfortable.  My dentist Cafer, he is amazing . Thank you all team!!
These guys truly went above and beyond any expectations I had coming over.

I was nervous coming over as it’s a big procedure I wanted doing (20 crowns, 3 root canals & fillings) and the organising part was good but not really telling. It was organised after phone calls and many conversations over WhatsApp, what done it for me with these guys was the no deposit I just had to sent flight details and confirm I had booked it.

My plane arrived slightly delayed and which did not cause any issues with the pick up in Antalya, was easy to find and the VIP transport provided was good.

The hotel I stayed at was the one next to the practice. The hotel was nothing special but I wasn’t expecting anything luxury so I was happy. Hotel reception was great.

The first day I went in to the practice, they got me seen straight away, took me through the consultation and put me at ease immediately… I cannot explain how at ease and comfortable I was made to feel.

From start to finish the procedures were painless, they was very generous with injections and truly did prioritise my comfort throughout.

In between appointments I was communicated with clearly and kept in the loop with what was happening next and when I was due to go back in.

The service didn’t just stop inside the practice, many times they helped me with navigating my way around town but getting me bus cards and even taking me to places in the transfer on a few occasions.

The 2 ladies who done all my procedure are a credit to the clinic, never have I ever enjoyed going to sit in a dental chair before this experience! Yusuf & the staff are genuinely nice and courteous people and Efdal is someone who I will certainly keep in contact with, great guy!

I have come home a different person, my teeth were executed PERFECTLY and look completely natural which is what I asked for.

I will happily open the door for a conversation with anyone who is debating whether to book with these guys… if I can provide you comfort and reassurance it is the least I can do for these guys.

Worth every single penny and more! Guys, thank you so much. You have changed my smile & my life.

Herşey için teşekkürler!

I found the whole experience with Antalara Dental Clinic very professional from start to finish. They reassured me all the way supporting me with making decisons and offering lots of advoce and suppprt. From the initial appointment in Manchester to the flights and arrival in Turkey I felt supported snd fully in formed. One person who supported me on arrival, with transfers to the clinic for appointments and accommodation was Yousef. The wonderful customer relations person. I am looking forward for my second visit to meet Yousef again and receiving my final treatment.
What a great experience I had with Antlara Dental clinic. From start to finish, all of the staff really care about your treatment. The technology for X-rays scans are brilliant and the head dentist consultation was very informative and she gave great advice on the best treatment recommendations. My dentist Dr Merve and her technician were fantastic and ensured that the work on my teeth was totally pain free. They are very thorough and the attention to detail is so impressive. My patient coordinator, Raziye was so good and did everything to ensure that I was aware of every stage in the process. She would contact me every evening to let me know when my transport for my appointments would arrive. This lady really goes the extra mile to look after her clients . Overall I would thoroughly recommend Antlara Dental Clinic to anyone .
After seeing an advertisement on a popular social media site, I did some research and contacted Antlara Dental via WhatsApp. They were very quickly to reply and very helpful with their recommended course of treatment. They booked my appointment with no deposit needed, just the flight information, and they even gave me a discount for booking out of season. When I arrived at the airport in Turkey, there was a transfer waiting with my name on it and a short while later I was comfortable in my hotel room. Dental consultation at the clinic was the next day with Head Dentist Dilek, taxi picked me up on time from the the hotel  and took me on short journey to the clinic. Burcu and Yusuf greeted me at the clinic everyday and made me feel very comfortable with friendly conversation and refreshments while waiting. Dr Ozden was my dentist who performed the procedure, she was very professional and confident in her work that made me feel at ease. Everything went well, and they was happy to do any minor adjustments that I wanted and put any concerns I had to rest. Plenty of medication was provided, the price was good, the hotel was very nice, food was good, everyone spoke good English and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would 100% go again.
My journey started in July 23 where I had 5 implants, bone graft followed by my second visit which involved 14 crowns upper and 14 crowns lower.
The professionalism of the staff and the hospitality I received from beginning to the end was quite unbelievable, I am so happy with my teeth and my new smile which I have craved for so long.
A few names that stood out for me was Raziye and Yusuf who coordinated my journey, the price was really good, also the equipment they use over in Turkey is so good, I could go on and on.... but please have a look at their reviews Antlara Dental ....you will not he disappointed    well done all and thank you so much.

Wow I can highly recommend this dental practice!
My experience has been fantastic from start to finish. Since arriving, everything has been organised through the company from hotel transfers from the airport and taken to the dental practice When needed. Raziye, was my coordinator and very lovely and helpful.
My surgeon Dr  Hakan was fantastic throughout, my treatment, having a Thorough, consultation.
I was very nervous having  2 Dental implants with a sinus and bone graft he total made my experience comfortable.
I had a full scan and after treatment, I had another scan to check the implants are in place being provided with full medication in a lovely welcome pack with smoothies to drink after treatment.
I am so happy with the treatment and 100% recommend Antlara for any dental issues there amazing

Had my tooth extracted by Dr. Musa Kartoz in Global Dental Center. It was good experience, the doctor informed me about all the process, gave me enough anesthesia to feel no pain. The price was told me before the procedure and there were no additional costs after. Well done.

Great experience with Global Dental Centre.
Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling from the UK to get their perfect smile : )
I had a great experience with the doctors who treated my jaw fractures. They were always professional, polite, and spoke English fluently. I'm grateful for their help during my six-month recovery, which went smoothly. Thank you, doctors! I hope to see you again soon.
Amazing dental practice. Well spoken English.  The best in Turkey. They explain the whole process leaving you stress free with great prices and services. Couldn’t be more happier.

Amazing, professional and friendly staff. I could see the professionalism of the doctors. I had an emergency situation and they sorted out quickly.They have done such an amazing job. I highly recommend Oris Dental Turkey.
I visited this dental clinic for a few procedures. I have an ongoing implant - which is going great and I've had no problem or pain so far - I had a root canal treatment followed by a filling which were both amazing. The filled tooth looks just like other teeth!
Both dentists (Dr. Dervişhan Küçük and Dr. Nehir Yapar) are highly professional and kind.
All other staff are quite welcoming and approachable.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Good day, everyone   
I've just finished my teeth done at this clinic. Now,thanks to them, I have an amazing smile.
I just want to mention a few things, Miss Meltem was very professional and guided me in perfect English, step by step all the procedures, and explained to me all my questions and my concerns.
Mrs. Esra is a perfectionist and very professional as well, plus the fact that she is an angel    with all her patience that she had with me.
And of course, the last but not the least, Mr. Erdem, just amazing and a true master of dentistry.
Overall, I felt welcomed and treated with respect by everyone at the clinic.
Thank you all for an amazing job
Just finished my treatment with Ozdemir Dental Centre.  I can honestly say that they are all highly professional and friendly.  The process from start to finish was very smooth. I can recommend them 100%
Great service
I visited the clinic in August this year while we’ve been on holiday in Antalya. Beautiful clinic with really friendly people.
Few days ago they’ve been to Liverpool Dr Erdem and few more colleagues. We met them for consultation. Very well organised team in a nice hotel     
Even small entertainment place in corner of room for my 2 little boys   
Hopefully we( me and my wife)can go to Antalya soon for treatment
Thanks again Dr Erdem and Büşra and Batur bay and others
This place is first class.
A big thank you to ursin and a very special assistent.
(Izmet). Keep up the good work as i will recomend you to anyone needing medical treatment.
Booked a laser teeth whitening treatment for my Türkiye holiday. The treatment was quite straight forward and the place was very friendly and professional.

Meltem who works there was very sweet and helpful!
A great dental clinic with amazing , friendly and well trained staff. Honest consultation and a very quality job. Went in for a filling and scaling, then i ve been told that i do not need to fill it in as it is good enough. That is a very high level of business ethics and professionalism. The dental job was quick, comfortable , clean and at an amazing price. I totally recommend this clinic to everyone specially , international visitors and expats.
Me and my husband arrived home from Turkey on Saturday after visiting Ozdemir Dental centre. We stayed at Tema 242 for our stay and was more than happy with the free accommodation.
I had 24 zirconium crowns fitted, before arriving in turkey I was absolutely terrified at the thought of having my teeth shaved down but was put at complete ease from the moment we entered the dental centre. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. I can’t thank Batur enough for helping us through the whole process.

I couldn’t be happier with my new smile and highly recommend Ozdemir dental to everyone. A pain free positive experience.
Over the years I have had various dental procedures carried out by Dr Erdem to the highest standard. The clinic is very modern and hygienic with the most up to date equipment. All of the clinic staff are very professional and friendly. My latest course of treatment was with Dr Esra and Dr Erdem. I had deep cleaning, whitening and afterwards Dr Esra replaced 2 very old crowns and in addition I had composite bonding to 8 of my upper teeth which has transformed my smile. I can honestly say it was completely painless, the whole procedure was completed within the time frame and I am so thrilled with the results which are beautiful and very natural. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend this clinic.
Amazing service from start to finish, a dentist where they genuinely care for you and your teeth not just what looks best/costs more. All the staff are so friendly and Helpful. Any issues are dealt with promptly the service they provided is outstanding. I recommend this place to everyone it’s really affordable, clean and their patient care is impeccable.
Glad to have found this clinic on facebook. Batur was excellent in communicating with me and organising my travel from airport to hotel to clinic. Dr Melisa and her assistant Bushra did a fantastic job on the the zirconia crowns I got there. Thank all for your good work!
